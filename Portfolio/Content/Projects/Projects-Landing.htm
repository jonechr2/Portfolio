                <p>I&#160;was an essential part of a small project team to implement a company intranet using the ThoughtFarmer platform. The intranet, called Toggle, is a one-stop shop for employee resources and communication. I&#160;also developed and delivered all of the kick-off training materials and continuing training for using the intranet, which included print, video, and in-person training. </p>
