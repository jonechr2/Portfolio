        <h1>Read (about) Me</h1>
        <h2>Hi. I'm Chris. </h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Photo.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>First and foremost, I am a writer. It’s what I love to do. It’s how I conceptualize and articulate the world around me. But I’m also a tenacious problem solver and teacher. I'm a tinkerer and I&#160;like to get my hands dirty figuring out solutions. I believe that writing, at it's core, is problem solving. One of my favorite aspects of technical writing is getting to experience and learn new products and translate that to an end-user by creating dynamic and engaging learning experiences. </p>
        <p>In my professional (and even personal) life, I&#160;am driven by four core tenets which I&#160;will outline here. </p>
        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>I am a super sleuth. I have a desire to understand how and why things work. I use all available resources to solve problems and get the job done. This has been a major factor in my success as a technical writer, and as a leader of a tech writing and training team– I am always seeking understanding. Whether it’s interacting with SMEs, researching complex problems with team members, or working with clients to gather data, I endeavor to be a difference maker both as a leader and as an individual contributor.</p>
        <p>In my technical writing position at Amazon, I was challenged from day one to help meet a critical deadline for launching a new training content platform. Between meetings with stakeholders, developers, and reworking legacy documentation with SMEs, I didn’t see my desk for my first two weeks on the job. Solving difficult technology problems in creative ways allowed me to make meaningful contributions from day one. As a result, we were able to successfully launch a logistics training platform in 11 languages to our employee’s all over the world. The experience of managing translation, developing content, and training team members on how to use the authoring tool helped to establish me as a leader.</p>
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>In my current leadership role at TEAM Software, I am a trusted expert in source control systems like Git, content management systems such as WordPress and Drupal, authoring tools such as MadCap Flare, and training tools like Captivate and Intellum’s Exceed LMS. I’m also the resident HTML, CSS, and JQuery expert, often helping our marketing department resolve issues with their WordPress website and email automations. I’m also a structured authoring and single sourcing expert, building web portals that leverage existing content but presenting them in dynamic and intuitive ways for our end users. Most recently, I built and deployed a sophisticated customer training and documentation portal (called the <a href="http://help.teamsoftware.com/">Learning Center</a>) that combined all our documentation and training resources into a single place for our clients. This replaced the need to email large Word or PDF files back and forth to clients, while also allowing a single person to update multiple learning resources (course objectives, procedures, images) from a master source.</p>
        <p>I’m also a recognized industry expert, contributing to technical writing, MadCap, and training groups via forums, Slack, conferences, and presenting webinars for MadCap on how to use <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/webinars/leveraging-power-of-relationship-tables-in-madcap-flare/">relationship tables</a> and build out <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/webinars/replacing-learning-management-system-with-madcap-flare/">dynamic learning experiences</a>.  I consistently strive to participate in professional development opportunities to better my leadership and technical skills. </p>
        <h3>Passion</h3>
        <p>It’s cliché, but true, that I love technical writing. It is not hyperbole to say that I’ve never met another person as passionate as I am about being a technical writer. As a tinkerer, technical writing provides me the chance to break down complex systems and explain them back to make people’s lives and jobs a little bit easier. I am dedicated to this task. I’ve also developed a passion for leading teams. I constantly strive to be better, knowing that as I progress in my career I won’t always get it right, but I’ll always learn and grow.</p>
        <h3>Data Driven Results</h3>
        <p>I am a natural problem solver because I enjoy thinking about complex, often abstract issues. But I use my problem-solving skills to be a great leader who drives results. Few things build trust more than results. I was brought on at TEAM Software to lead what had been two separate teams (Tech Comm and TEAM University). I developed KPIs for our team, as well as implemented Smartsheet for project management and resource allocation. By aligning the efforts of our technical writers and instructional designers, our team was able to reduce redundancies and increase our output significantly. In addition, through targeted efforts we have grown engagement with content nearly 1000% from 2018.</p>
