        <h2>Leveraging the Power of Relationship Tables in MadCap Flare</h2>
        <p>A relationship table is an element used to link related topics together in MadCap Flare (similar to concept links or related topics links). Focusing primarily on relationship tables for online output, this webinar will discuss the differences between relationship tables and other similar features such as concepts and menus, and will focus on the advantages that relationship tables offer compared to the other features.</p>
        <p>In this webinar, we will cover key concepts including:</p>
        <p> <ul><li>What are Relationship Tables?</li><li>Differences between Relationship Tables and Flare’s Concepts, Related Topics, and Menus Proxies</li><li>Working with Relationship Tables in Flare</li><li>Styling Relationship Tables</li></ul></p>
        <p>By the end of this presentation, you will be able to create your own tables and insert proxies into appropriate topics/master pages. You will also know how relationship tables can be uniquely manipulated using stylesheets.</p>
